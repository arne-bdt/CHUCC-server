## Task Categories

### 1. Java APIs

**Goal:** Create plain Java APIs for SPARQL Protocol and Graph Store Protocol that can be used without HTTP overhead.

**Current State:** Only HTTP endpoints available.

**Target State:** Clean Java APIs for embedded use, testing, and library integration.

| Task | File | Priority | Est. Time | Status |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 01. Create Java SPARQL API | `java-api/01-create-java-sparql-api.md` | Medium | 3-4 hours | 📋 Not Started |
| 02. Create Java Graph Store API | `java-api/02-create-java-graph-store-api.md` | Medium | 3-4 hours | 📋 Not Started |

**Dependencies:** Task 01 should be completed first to establish API patterns.

**API Style:**
```java
// SPARQL Protocol API
@Autowired
private SparqlProtocolApi api;

SparqlQueryResult result = api.query(
    "SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10",
    SparqlSelector.branch("main")
);

// Graph Store Protocol API
@Autowired
private GraphStoreProtocolApi api;

Optional<Model> model = api.getGraph(
    "http://example.org/graph1",
    GraphSelector.branch("main")
);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Embedded applications
- Unit testing without HTTP overhead
- Library integration
- Microservices communication

**Benefits:**
- No HTTP serialization/deserialization overhead
- Direct method invocation (10-100x faster)
- Type-safe API (compile-time checking)
- Better for testing (no need to start HTTP server)

---

### 2. Kafka Best Practices

**Goal:** Implement Kafka CQRS/Event Sourcing best practices based on industry standards.

**Current State:** CHUCC Server uses Kafka for event sourcing with improved best practices:
- ✅ Partition key uses aggregate-ID pattern (ensures ordering guarantees)
- ✅ Event deduplication implemented (UUIDv7-based exactly-once processing)
- ✅ Correlation ID for distributed tracing (timestamp header included)
- ✅ Event serialization tests (comprehensive JSON round-trip validation)
- ✅ Snapshot metadata caching (on-demand loading from Kafka)
- ⚠️ Consumer isolation level not set to read_committed

**Target State:** Production-ready Kafka CQRS/ES implementation with practical safeguards.

| Task | File | Priority | Est. Time | Status |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 01. Fix Partition Key Strategy | `kafka-best-practices/01-fix-partition-key-strategy.md` | 🔴 **CRITICAL** | 3-4 hours | ✅ Completed |
| 02. Implement Event Deduplication | `kafka-best-practices/02-implement-event-deduplication.md` | 🔴 **CRITICAL** | 3-4 hours | ✅ Completed |
| 03. Add Correlation ID for Distributed Tracing | `kafka-best-practices/03-add-event-metadata-headers.md` | 🟡 Medium | 1-1.5 hours | ✅ Completed |
| 04. Add Event Serialization Tests | `kafka-best-practices/04-add-event-serialization-tests.md` | 🟡 Medium | 30-45 min | ✅ Completed |
| 05. Transaction Support for Consumers | `kafka-best-practices/06-add-transaction-support-for-consumers.md` | 🟡 Medium | 2 hours | 📋 Not Started |

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Task 02 completed (Task 01 prerequisite)
- ✅ Task 03 completed (Task 02 prerequisite)
- None for remaining task

**Impact:**

**Completed:**
1. ✅ **Partition Key Strategy** - Aggregate-ID based partitioning ensures ordering
2. ✅ **Event Deduplication** - Exactly-once processing with UUIDv7 cache
3. ✅ **Correlation ID** - Full distributed tracing across HTTP → Kafka → Projector
4. ✅ **Serialization Tests** - Comprehensive JSON round-trip validation for all 12 event types

**Remaining (Production-Ready):**
5. **Transaction Support** - Data integrity for consumers (2 hours) ← **Next task**

**Estimated Remaining Time:** 2 hours

**Deferred (Premature Optimization):**
- **Snapshot Compaction Strategy** - Current metadata caching (Caffeine) is sufficient for current scale (~100 snapshots, ~100MB storage). Proposed Kafka log compaction would use `dataset:branch` key which would delete historical snapshots needed for time-travel queries. Revisit when: (1) snapshot storage exceeds 10GB, OR (2) query latency exceeds 500ms, OR (3) alternative key design solves historical retention requirement.
- **Schema Registry** - Over-engineered for current single-app architecture. Revisit when external consumers emerge (polyglot microservices, data analytics, third-party integrations)

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Java APIs (Medium Priority)

**Goal:** Provide programmatic access for embedded use cases

2. 📋 `java-api/01-create-java-sparql-api.md` (3-4 hours)
3. 📋 `java-api/02-create-java-graph-store-api.md` (3-4 hours)

**Rationale:** Nice-to-have for embedded use. Can be deferred if time-constrained.

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours total
