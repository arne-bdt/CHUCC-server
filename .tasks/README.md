# CHUCC Server - Task Roadmap

This directory contains task breakdowns for implementing the remaining SPARQL 1.2 Protocol Version Control Extension endpoints. Each task is designed to be completable in one development session (3-6 hours).

---

## Status: IN PROGRESS

**Previously:** All original tasks were completed and removed (October 24, 2025)

**Now:** 5 tasks remain to implement protocol endpoints that currently return 501 "Not Implemented"

**Recent Completions:**
- patchSize Schema Evolution (2025-01-24) - CQRS Compliant ✅
- Branch Management API (2025-10-24)

---

## Remaining Tasks

### 🔴 High Priority

#### 1. Tag Management API
**File:** [`.tasks/tags/01-implement-tag-list-and-create-api.md`](./tags/01-implement-tag-list-and-create-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/tags` - List all tags
- `POST /version/tags` - Create new immutable tag

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Protocol Spec:** §3.5

**Already Implemented:**
- ✅ `GET /version/tags/{name}` - Get tag details
- ✅ `DELETE /version/tags/{name}` - Delete tag

---

#### 2. Merge Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/merge/01-implement-merge-api.md`](./merge/01-implement-merge-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/merge` - Merge two refs/commits

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours (most complex)
**Protocol Spec:** §3.3

**Complexity:**
- Three-way merge algorithm
- Conflict detection
- Multiple merge strategies (three-way, ours, theirs, manual)
- Fast-forward detection

---

### 🟡 Medium Priority

#### 3. History & Diff API
**File:** [`.tasks/history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md`](./history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/history` - List commit history with filters
- `GET /version/diff` - Diff two commits (returns RDF Patch)
- `GET /version/blame` - Last-writer attribution

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** §3.2 (history), Extensions (diff, blame)

**Note:** Diff and blame are **extensions** (not in official SPARQL 1.2 spec)

---

#### 4a. ✅ Add patchSize to Commit Entity (COMPLETED)
**File:** [`.tasks/commits/00-add-patchsize-to-commit-entity.md`](./commits/00-add-patchsize-to-commit-entity.md)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Add `patchSize` field to `Commit` entity
- ✅ Add `patchSize` field to `CommitCreatedEvent`
- ✅ Update all command handlers to compute patchSize
- ✅ Update ReadModelProjector

**Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-01-24)
**Actual Time:** ~3 hours
**Category:** Schema Evolution

**CQRS Compliance:** ✅ Excellent (verified by cqrs-compliance-checker)

---

#### 4b. Commit Metadata API
**File:** [`.tasks/commits/01-implement-commit-metadata-api.md`](./commits/01-implement-commit-metadata-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/commits/{id}?dataset={name}` - Get commit metadata

**Status:** Ready to Start (Blocker 4a removed!)
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Protocol Spec:** §3.2

**Design:** Minimal implementation (id, message, author, timestamp, parents, patchSize)
- No branches/tags lists (expensive O(n) scan)
- Read-only, no CQRS complexity

**Already Implemented:**
- ✅ `POST /version/commits` - Create commit (apply RDF Patch)

---

#### 5. Batch Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md`](./batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/batch` - Execute batch of SPARQL operations atomically

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** §3.6

**Features:**
- Atomic and non-atomic execution modes
- Single commit mode (combine all writes)
- Mixed operations (query, update, applyPatch)

**Note:** Distinct from `/version/batch-graphs` (Graph Store Protocol batch endpoint)

---

### 🔵 Low Priority (Technical Debt)

#### 6. Add patchSize to Revert/CherryPick Events
**File:** [`.tasks/architecture/01-add-patchsize-to-revert-cherrypick-events.md`](./architecture/01-add-patchsize-to-revert-cherrypick-events.md)

**Changes:**
- Add `patchSize` field to `RevertCreatedEvent`
- Add `patchSize` field to `CherryPickedEvent`
- Update command handlers to compute patchSize
- Remove business logic from ReadModelProjector

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Category:** Event Schema Evolution / CQRS Compliance

**Why:**
- Consistency with CommitCreatedEvent
- Eliminates business logic from projector (read side)
- Events should be fully self-contained

---

#### 7. Refactor Squash/Rebase Handlers to Pure CQRS
**File:** [`.tasks/architecture/02-refactor-squash-rebase-to-pure-cqrs.md`](./architecture/02-refactor-squash-rebase-to-pure-cqrs.md)

**Problem:**
- `SquashCommandHandler` and `RebaseCommandHandler` write directly to repository
- Violates CQRS pattern (dual-write, no event replay)
- Breaks eventual consistency promise

**Solution:**
- Enrich events with full commit data (patch, patchSize, parents)
- Remove repository writes from command handlers
- Let projector handle all repository updates

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours
**Category:** Architectural Refactoring
**Complexity:** High

**Note:** This is technical debt, not a critical bug. Can be deferred.

---

## Progress Summary

**Feature Tasks:** 5 tasks (5 endpoint implementations)
**Schema Evolution:** 1 task (completed)
**Architecture/Technical Debt:** 2 tasks (optional improvements)

**Total Endpoints:** 11 endpoints to implement
**Total Estimated Time:** 31-43 hours (features) + 10-15 hours (architecture)

**Priority Breakdown:**
- 🔴 High Priority: 2 tasks (Tags, Merge)
- 🟡 Medium Priority: 3 tasks (History, Commits, Batch)
- 🔵 Low Priority: 2 tasks (Architecture improvements - optional)

**Current Status:** 1 of 6 feature tasks completed (17%)
- ✅ Task 4a: patchSize Schema Evolution (completed 2025-01-24)
- ✅ Branch Management API (completed 2025-10-24)

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Feature Implementation

1. ✅ **Add patchSize to Commit Entity** (3-4 hours) - **COMPLETED 2025-01-24**
   - Schema evolution task
   - Blocking task for Commit Metadata API
   - CQRS compliance verified

2. **Commit Metadata API** (1-2 hours) - **UNBLOCKED**
   - Simplest endpoint task
   - Read-only, no CQRS complexity
   - Good warm-up after schema change
   - **Depends on Task 1**

3. **Tag Management API** (3-4 hours)
   - Similar to branches (already implemented)
   - Immutability adds slight complexity

4. **History & Diff API** (4-5 hours)
   - Read-only operations
   - Diff requires RDF Patch serialization

5. **Batch Operations API** (4-5 hours)
   - Complex but modular
   - Reuses existing query/update logic

6. **Merge Operations API** (5-6 hours)
   - Most complex task
   - Requires merge algorithm
   - Should be implemented last

### Architecture/Technical Debt (Optional)

These tasks improve CQRS compliance and event structure but are not required for feature completeness:

**A. Add patchSize to Revert/CherryPick Events** (2-3 hours)
   - Low complexity, similar to completed Task 4a
   - Removes business logic from projector
   - Improves event consistency
   - **Recommended:** Implement after Task 2 (Commit Metadata API)

**B. Refactor Squash/Rebase to Pure CQRS** (8-12 hours)
   - High complexity, significant refactoring
   - Fixes dual-write pattern and event replay
   - Enables proper eventual consistency testing
   - **Recommended:** Defer until production deployment is planned

## Task File Structure

Each task file includes:

1. **Overview** - What needs to be implemented
2. **Current State** - What's already done
3. **Requirements** - API specification
4. **Implementation Steps** - Detailed step-by-step guide
5. **Success Criteria** - Definition of done
6. **Testing Strategy** - Test approach (API vs Projector tests)
7. **Files to Create/Modify** - Complete file list
8. **References** - Links to protocol specs and code

---

## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting a Task

1. Read the task file completely
2. Review the protocol specification
3. Check existing similar implementations for patterns
4. Plan test cases

### During Implementation

1. Follow TDD (write tests first)
2. Use `-q` flag for Maven commands
3. Run static analysis before tests: `mvn -q compile checkstyle:check spotbugs:check`
4. Implement incrementally (DTOs → Command/Event → Handler → Controller)
5. **Invoke specialized agents** after implementation:
   - `@cqrs-compliance-checker` after command/projector changes
   - `@test-isolation-validator` after writing tests
   - `@event-schema-evolution-checker` after modifying events

### After Implementation

1. Run full build: `mvn -q clean install`
2. Verify zero quality violations
3. Create conventional commit message
4. **Delete the task file** when completed
5. Update this README (move task to "Completed Tasks" section)

---

## Testing Strategy

### API Layer Tests (90% of tests)
- Projector **DISABLED** by default
- Test HTTP status codes and headers
- Do **NOT** query repositories
- Example: `BranchControllerIT`

### Projector Tests (10% of tests)
- Projector **ENABLED** via `@TestPropertySource(properties = "projector.kafka-listener.enabled=true")`
- Use `await()` pattern for async verification
- Test event projection to repositories
- Example: `ReadModelProjectorIT`

See [Development Guidelines](../.claude/CLAUDE.md) for detailed testing patterns.
