**Now:** 8 tasks remain (3 protocol endpoints + 1 technical debt + 4 architecture enhancements)

**Recent Completions:**
- patchSize Schema Evolution (2025-01-24) - CQRS Compliant ✅
- Branch Management API (2025-10-24)
- Dataset Management + Kafka Integration (2025-10-26) ✅

---

## Remaining Tasks

### 🟠 High Priority (Architecture Enhancement)

#### 0. Materialized Branch Views - Continuously Updated DatasetGraphs
**Directory:** [`.tasks/materialized-views/`](./materialized-views/)

**Goal:** Move from on-demand graph materialization to eager materialization for instant query performance.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Tasks 01-02 Completed, 03-04 Remaining)
**Estimated Time:** 13-17 hours (4 tasks)
**Category:** Architecture Enhancement
**Completion:** 50% (2/4 tasks completed)

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ [Task 01: Create MaterializedBranchRepository Infrastructure](./materialized-views/01-create-materialized-branch-repository.md) (3-4 hours) - COMPLETED 2025-10-26
   - Created MaterializedBranchRepository interface
   - Implemented InMemoryMaterializedBranchRepository with per-branch locking
   - Custom RDFChangesApply to bypass Jena transaction management
   - 16 unit tests (all passing)

2. ✅ [Task 02: Update ReadModelProjector for Eager Materialization](./materialized-views/02-update-projector-for-eager-materialization.md) (4-5 hours) - COMPLETED 2025-10-26
   - Updated ReadModelProjector to apply patches eagerly
   - Handle branch creation/deletion in materialized views
   - 4 integration tests (MaterializedGraphProjectionIT, all passing)
   - **Note:** CQRS agent identified exception handling improvements needed (see follow-up tasks)

3. [Task 03: Update DatasetService to Use Materialized Views](./materialized-views/03-update-datasetservice-for-materialized-views.md) (3-4 hours)
   - Use pre-materialized graphs for branch HEAD queries (instant response)
   - Keep on-demand building for historical commits (backward compatible)
   - Performance tests demonstrating 10-20x improvement

4. [Task 04: Add Monitoring and Recovery Mechanisms](./materialized-views/04-add-monitoring-and-recovery.md) (3-4 hours)
   - Micrometer metrics (graph count, memory, operations)
   - Health checks for materialized views
   - Manual rebuild endpoint for recovery

**Technical Debt Identified (from CQRS agent review):**
- Exception handling in projector needs improvement (rethrow vs swallow)
- Idempotency check needed for branch creation
- Transaction management documentation needed

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **10-20x faster** branch HEAD queries (<10ms vs 100-200ms)
- ✅ Memory usage scales with branches, not history depth
- ✅ CQRS compliant (projector maintains materialized views)
- ✅ Backward compatible (historical queries unchanged)
- ✅ Production-ready monitoring and recovery

**CQRS Compliance:** ✅ Full compliance
- Projector applies patches to materialized graphs (read model updates)
- DatasetService returns materialized graphs (query side)
- Events remain source of truth in CommitRepository

---

### 🔴 High Priority

#### 1. Merge Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/merge/01-implement-merge-api.md`](./merge/01-implement-merge-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/merge` - Merge two refs/commits

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours (most complex)
**Protocol Spec:** §3.3

**Complexity:**
- Three-way merge algorithm
- Conflict detection
- Multiple merge strategies (three-way, ours, theirs, manual)
- Fast-forward detection

---

### 🟡 Medium Priority

#### 2. History & Diff API
**File:** [`.tasks/history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md`](./history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/history` - List commit history with filters
- `GET /version/diff` - Diff two commits (returns RDF Patch)
- `GET /version/blame` - Last-writer attribution

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** §3.2 (history), Extensions (diff, blame)

**Note:** Diff and blame are **extensions** (not in official SPARQL 1.2 spec)

---

#### 3. Batch Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md`](./batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/batch` - Execute batch of SPARQL operations atomically

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** §3.6

**Features:**
- Atomic and non-atomic execution modes
- Single commit mode (combine all writes)
- Mixed operations (query, update, applyPatch)

**Note:** Distinct from `/version/batch-graphs` (Graph Store Protocol batch endpoint)

---

### 🔵 Low Priority (Technical Debt)

#### 4. Refactor Squash/Rebase Handlers to Pure CQRS
**File:** [`.tasks/architecture/02-refactor-squash-rebase-to-pure-cqrs.md`](./architecture/02-refactor-squash-rebase-to-pure-cqrs.md)

**Problem:**
- `SquashCommandHandler` and `RebaseCommandHandler` write directly to repository
- Violates CQRS pattern (dual-write, no event replay)
- Breaks eventual consistency promise

**Solution:**
- Enrich events with full commit data (patch, patchSize, parents)
- Remove repository writes from command handlers
- Let projector handle all repository updates

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours
**Category:** Architectural Refactoring
**Complexity:** High

**Note:** This is technical debt, not a critical bug. Can be deferred.

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

### ✅ Infrastructure (Critical) - COMPLETED

**Status:** All infrastructure tasks completed (2025-10-26)

1. ✅ **Dataset Creation Endpoint** (completed)
   - Enables dynamic dataset creation without DevOps
   - Creates Kafka topics automatically
   - See commit a91f9f2

2. ✅ **Production Kafka Config** (completed)
   - Production safety with RF=3
   - See commit 0ad6c89

   - Proactive issue detection via Micrometer
   - See commits 654ba92, 6612682

### Architecture Enhancement (Recommended First)

**Materialized Branch Views** (13-17 hours total)

**Why first:**
- Significant performance improvement (10-20x faster queries)
- Foundation for better user experience
- Independent of protocol endpoints (can be done in parallel)
- Production-ready monitoring and recovery

**Implementation order:**
1. **Task 01: MaterializedBranchRepository** (3-4 hours)
   - Foundation layer - no dependencies
   - Can be tested in isolation

2. **Task 02: Update ReadModelProjector** (4-5 hours)
   - Integrates with existing projector
   - Enables eager materialization

3. **Task 03: Update DatasetService** (3-4 hours)
   - Instant query performance
   - Backward compatible

4. **Task 04: Monitoring & Recovery** (3-4 hours)
   - Production operational tools
   - Completes the feature

**Alternatively:** Implement in parallel with protocol endpoints if multiple developers available.

---

### Feature Implementation

1. **History & Diff API** (4-5 hours)
   - Read-only operations
   - Diff requires RDF Patch serialization
   - Useful for debugging and auditing

2. **Batch Operations API** (4-5 hours)
   - Complex but modular
   - Reuses existing query/update logic
   - Performance optimization for bulk operations

3. **Merge Operations API** (5-6 hours)
   - Most complex task
   - Requires merge algorithm
   - Should be implemented last

### Infrastructure (Future/Optional)

**Recommended:** Defer until after feature implementation is complete.

5. **Per-Dataset Tuning** (4-5 hours)
   - Allows custom Kafka config per dataset
   - Nice-to-have for advanced use cases
   - Can be added later without breaking changes

6. **Topic Health Checks** (4-5 hours)
   - Automated health checks and self-healing
   - Improves operational reliability
   - Can be added incrementally

### Architecture/Technical Debt (Optional)

This task improves CQRS compliance but is not required for feature completeness:

**Refactor Squash/Rebase to Pure CQRS** (8-12 hours)
   - High complexity, significant refactoring
   - Fixes dual-write pattern and event replay
   - Enables proper eventual consistency testing
   - **Recommended:** Defer until production deployment is planned

## Task File Structure

Each task file includes:

1. **Overview** - What needs to be implemented
2. **Current State** - What's already done
3. **Requirements** - API specification
4. **Implementation Steps** - Detailed step-by-step guide

---

## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting a Task

1. Read the task file completely
2. Review the protocol specification
3. Check existing similar implementations for patterns
4. Plan test cases

### During Implementation

1. Follow TDD (write tests first)
2. Use `-q` flag for Maven commands
3. Run static analysis before tests: `mvn -q compile checkstyle:check spotbugs:check`
4. Implement incrementally (DTOs → Command/Event → Handler → Controller)
5. **Invoke specialized agents** after implementation:
   - `@cqrs-compliance-checker` after command/projector changes
   - `@test-isolation-validator` after writing tests
   - `@event-schema-evolution-checker` after modifying events

### After Implementation

1. Run full build: `mvn -q clean install`
2. Verify zero quality violations
3. Create conventional commit message
4. **Delete the task file** when completed
5. Update this README (move task to "Completed Tasks" section)

---

## Testing Strategy

### API Layer Tests (90% of tests)
- Projector **DISABLED** by default
- Test HTTP status codes and headers
- Do **NOT** query repositories
- Example: `BranchControllerIT`

### Projector Tests (10% of tests)
- Projector **ENABLED** via `@TestPropertySource(properties = "projector.kafka-listener.enabled=true")`
- Use `await()` pattern for async verification
- Test event projection to repositories
- Example: `ReadModelProjectorIT`

See [Development Guidelines](../.claude/CLAUDE.md) for detailed testing patterns.

---

## Success Criteria for All Tasks

- ✅ All endpoints return appropriate responses (no 501)
- ✅ DTOs created with validation
- ✅ CQRS pattern followed (Command → Event → Projector)
- ✅ Integration tests pass (API layer)
- ✅ Unit tests pass (command handlers)
- ✅ Zero quality violations (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, PMD, compiler warnings)
- ✅ Full build passes: `mvn -q clean install`
- ✅ Task file deleted after completion

---
