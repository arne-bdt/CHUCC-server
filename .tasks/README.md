# CHUCC Server - Task Roadmap

This directory contains task breakdowns for implementing the remaining SPARQL 1.2 Protocol Version Control Extension endpoints. Each task is designed to be completable in one development session (3-6 hours).

---

## Status: NEW TASKS ADDED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Previously:** All tasks were completed and removed (October 24, 2025)

**Now:** 6 new tasks added to implement protocol endpoints that currently return 501 "Not Implemented"

---

## New Tasks (Added 2025-10-24)

### üî¥ High Priority

#### 1. Branch Management API
**File:** [`.tasks/branches/01-implement-branch-list-and-create-api.md`](./branches/01-implement-branch-list-and-create-api.md)

---

## Progress Summary

**Total New Tasks:** 6 tasks
**Total Endpoints:** 11 endpoints
**Estimated Total Time:** 21-27 hours

**Priority Breakdown:**
- üî¥ High Priority: 3 tasks (Branches, Tags, Merge)
- üü° Medium Priority: 3 tasks (History, Commits, Batch)

**Current Status:** 0 of 6 tasks completed (0%)

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Commit Metadata API** (2-3 hours)
   - Simplest task
   - Read-only, no CQRS complexity
   - Good warm-up

2. **Branch Management API** (3-4 hours)
   - Essential functionality
   - Builds on existing delete branch handler

3. **Tag Management API** (3-4 hours)
   - Similar to branches
   - Immutability adds slight complexity

4. **History & Diff API** (4-5 hours)
   - Read-only operations
   - Diff requires RDF Patch serialization

5. **Batch Operations API** (4-5 hours)
   - Complex but modular
   - Reuses existing query/update logic

6. **Merge Operations API** (5-6 hours)
   - Most complex task
   - Requires merge algorithm
   - Should be implemented last

---

## Task File Structure

Each task file includes:

1. **Overview** - What needs to be implemented
2. **Current State** - What's already done
3. **Requirements** - API specification
4. **Implementation Steps** - Detailed step-by-step guide
5. **Success Criteria** - Definition of done
6. **Testing Strategy** - Test approach (API vs Projector tests)
7. **Files to Create/Modify** - Complete file list
8. **References** - Links to protocol specs and code

---

## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting a Task

1. Read the task file completely
2. Review the protocol specification
3. Check existing similar implementations for patterns
4. Plan test cases

### During Implementation

1. Follow TDD (write tests first)
2. Use `-q` flag for Maven commands
3. Run static analysis before tests: `mvn -q compile checkstyle:check spotbugs:check`
4. Implement incrementally (DTOs ‚Üí Command/Event ‚Üí Handler ‚Üí Controller)
5. **Invoke specialized agents** after implementation:
   - `@cqrs-compliance-checker` after command/projector changes
   - `@test-isolation-validator` after writing tests
   - `@event-schema-evolution-checker` after modifying events

### After Implementation

1. Run full build: `mvn -q clean install`
2. Verify zero quality violations
3. Create conventional commit message
4. **Delete the task file** when completed
5. Update this README (move task to "Completed" section)

---

## Testing Strategy

### API Layer Tests (90% of tests)
- Projector **DISABLED** by default
- Test HTTP status codes and headers
- Do **NOT** query repositories
- Example: `BranchControllerIT`

### Projector Tests (10% of tests)
- Projector **ENABLED** via `@TestPropertySource(properties = "projector.kafka-listener.enabled=true")`
- Use `await()` pattern for async verification
- Test event projection to repositories
- Example: `ReadModelProjectorIT`

See [Development Guidelines](../.claude/CLAUDE.md) for detailed testing patterns.

---

## Success Criteria for All Tasks

- ‚úÖ All endpoints return appropriate responses (no 501)
- ‚úÖ DTOs created with validation
- ‚úÖ CQRS pattern followed (Command ‚Üí Event ‚Üí Projector)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests pass (API layer)
- ‚úÖ Unit tests pass (command handlers)
- ‚úÖ Zero quality violations (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, PMD, compiler warnings)
- ‚úÖ Full build passes: `mvn -q clean install`
- ‚úÖ Task file deleted after completion
