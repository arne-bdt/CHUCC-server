# CHUCC Server - Task Roadmap

This directory contains task breakdowns for remaining features and enhancements planned for CHUCC Server. Each task is designed to be completable in one development session (3-6 hours).

---

## Overview

This roadmap tracks the **remaining tasks** for CHUCC Server. Completed tasks have been removed from this directory.

**Remaining task areas:**
1. **Java APIs** - Create plain Java APIs matching SPARQL and Graph Store protocols
2. **Refactoring** - Migrate from Model API to Graph API for performance improvements

---

## Completed Tasks

The following task areas have been **successfully completed** and their task files removed:

### ‚úÖ Snapshot Optimization (Completed)
- Snapshots now used for faster startup and query materialization
- SnapshotKafkaStore implemented for on-demand snapshot loading
- Metadata caching added for performance

### ‚úÖ Cache Optimization (Completed)
- LRU cache eviction implemented using Caffeine
- Bounded memory usage preventing OutOfMemoryError
- Cache metrics available via Actuator

### ‚úÖ Deletion Features (Completed)
- Branch deletion implemented with protection for main branch
- Dataset deletion implemented with confirmation requirement
- Optional Kafka topic cleanup support

For details on completed work, see git history:
```bash
git log --oneline --grep="cache\|snapshot\|deletion" --since="2025-10-01"
```

## Task Categories

### 1. Java APIs

**Goal:** Create plain Java APIs for SPARQL Protocol and Graph Store Protocol that can be used without HTTP overhead.

**Current State:** Only HTTP endpoints available.

**Target State:** Clean Java APIs for embedded use, testing, and library integration.

| Task | File | Priority | Est. Time | Status |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 01. Create Java SPARQL API | `java-api/01-create-java-sparql-api.md` | Medium | 3-4 hours | üìã Not Started |
| 02. Create Java Graph Store API | `java-api/02-create-java-graph-store-api.md` | Medium | 3-4 hours | üìã Not Started |

**Dependencies:** Task 01 should be completed first to establish API patterns.

**API Style:**
```java
// SPARQL Protocol API
@Autowired
private SparqlProtocolApi api;

SparqlQueryResult result = api.query(
    "SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10",
    SparqlSelector.branch("main")
);

// Graph Store Protocol API
@Autowired
private GraphStoreProtocolApi api;

Optional<Model> model = api.getGraph(
    "http://example.org/graph1",
    GraphSelector.branch("main")
);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Embedded applications
- Unit testing without HTTP overhead
- Library integration
- Microservices communication

**Benefits:**
- No HTTP serialization/deserialization overhead
- Direct method invocation (10-100x faster)
- Type-safe API (compile-time checking)
- Better for testing (no need to start HTTP server)

---

### 2. Refactoring - Model API to Graph API Migration

**Goal:** Improve performance and efficiency by migrating from Apache Jena's Model API to the lower-level Graph API.

**Current State:** Code uses Model API extensively.

**Target State:** Internal code uses Graph API; Model API only at boundaries.

See detailed breakdown: [`refactoring/README.md`](./refactoring/README.md)

| Task | File | Priority | Est. Time | Status |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 01. Migrate RdfParsingService | `refactoring/01-migrate-rdf-parsing-service.md` | High | 1-2 hours | üìã Not Started |
| 02. Migrate GraphSerializationService | `refactoring/02-migrate-graph-serialization-service.md` | High | 1-2 hours | üìã Not Started |
| 03. Migrate GraphDiffService | `refactoring/03-migrate-graph-diff-service.md` | High | 2-3 hours | üìã Not Started |

**Note:** Additional tasks (04-10) will be created after completing the foundational tasks 01-03.

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Performance:** 20-30% faster graph operations
- **Memory:** 15-25% reduction
- **Efficiency:** More efficient triple iteration
- **Direct access:** No wrapper object overhead

**Dependencies:** Tasks must be completed sequentially (01 ‚Üí 02 ‚Üí 03).

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Refactoring Foundation (Highest Priority)

**Goal:** Establish Graph API usage in foundational services

1. üìã `refactoring/01-migrate-rdf-parsing-service.md`
2. üìã `refactoring/02-migrate-graph-serialization-service.md`
3. üìã `refactoring/03-migrate-graph-diff-service.md`

**Rationale:** These changes unlock performance improvements across the entire codebase.

**Estimated Time:** 5-7 hours total

---

### Phase 2: Java APIs (Medium Priority)

**Goal:** Provide programmatic access for embedded use cases

4. üìã `java-api/01-create-java-sparql-api.md`
5. üìã `java-api/02-create-java-graph-store-api.md`

**Rationale:** Nice-to-have for embedded use. Can be deferred if time-constrained.

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours total

---

### Phase 3: Refactoring Completion (Lower Priority)

**Goal:** Complete Model-to-Graph migration

6. Tasks 04-10 (to be created after Phase 1)

**Rationale:** Finish what was started in Phase 1.

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours total

---

## How to Use This Roadmap

### For Developers

1. **Pick a task** from the appropriate phase
2. **Read the task file** thoroughly - it contains:
   - Context and goals
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Code examples and tests
   - Success criteria
3. **Implement the task** following TDD principles:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement incrementally
   - Run quality checks (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, PMD)
4. **Verify completion** using success criteria
5. **Commit and document** the changes
6. **Delete the task file** once completed

### For Project Managers

- **Phase 1 tasks are critical** - unlock performance improvements
- **Phase 2 tasks are features** - nice-to-have
- **Phase 3 tasks are cleanup** - complete the refactoring

### For Architects

- All tasks follow **CQRS + Event Sourcing** patterns (where applicable)
- All tasks maintain **backward compatibility**
- All tasks have **comprehensive tests**

## Metrics & Monitoring

After implementing Java API tasks, monitor:

**API Performance Metrics:**
- `api.sparql.query.time` - Query execution time
- `api.sparql.update.time` - Update execution time
- `api.graph.get.time` - Graph retrieval time

After implementing refactoring tasks, monitor:

**Performance Metrics:**
- `graph.diff.time` - Graph diff operation time (should decrease by 20-30%)
- `jvm.memory.used` - Heap usage (should decrease by 15-25%)

1. Create a new directory if needed (e.g., `.tasks/new-feature/`)
2. Follow the task template above
3. Ensure task is completable in one session (3-6 hours)
4. Include detailed implementation steps
5. Provide code examples
6. Define clear success criteria
7. Update this README with the new task
