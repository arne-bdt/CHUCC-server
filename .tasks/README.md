# CHUCC Server - Task Roadmap

This directory contains task breakdowns for implementing the remaining SPARQL 1.2 Protocol Version Control Extension endpoints. Each task is designed to be completable in one development session (3-6 hours).

---

## Status: IN PROGRESS

**Previously:** All original tasks were completed and removed (October 24, 2025)

**Now:** 6 tasks remain to implement protocol endpoints that currently return 501 "Not Implemented"

**Recent Completion:** Branch Management API (2025-10-24)

---

## Remaining Tasks

### üî¥ High Priority

#### 1. Tag Management API
**File:** [`.tasks/tags/01-implement-tag-list-and-create-api.md`](./tags/01-implement-tag-list-and-create-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/tags` - List all tags
- `POST /version/tags` - Create new immutable tag

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.5

**Already Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ `GET /version/tags/{name}` - Get tag details
- ‚úÖ `DELETE /version/tags/{name}` - Delete tag

---

#### 2. Merge Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/merge/01-implement-merge-api.md`](./merge/01-implement-merge-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/merge` - Merge two refs/commits

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours (most complex)
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.3

**Complexity:**
- Three-way merge algorithm
- Conflict detection
- Multiple merge strategies (three-way, ours, theirs, manual)
- Fast-forward detection

---

### üü° Medium Priority

#### 3. History & Diff API
**File:** [`.tasks/history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md`](./history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/history` - List commit history with filters
- `GET /version/diff` - Diff two commits (returns RDF Patch)
- `GET /version/blame` - Last-writer attribution

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.2 (history), Extensions (diff, blame)

**Note:** Diff and blame are **extensions** (not in official SPARQL 1.2 spec)

---

#### 4a. Add patchSize to Commit Entity (PREREQUISITE)
**File:** [`.tasks/commits/00-add-patchsize-to-commit-entity.md`](./commits/00-add-patchsize-to-commit-entity.md)

**Changes:**
- Add `patchSize` field to `Commit` entity
- Add `patchSize` field to `CommitCreatedEvent`
- Update all command handlers to compute patchSize
- Update ReadModelProjector

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Category:** Schema Evolution

**Notes:** This is a **blocking task** for 4b. Event schema change requires careful testing.

---

#### 4b. Commit Metadata API
**File:** [`.tasks/commits/01-implement-commit-metadata-api.md`](./commits/01-implement-commit-metadata-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/commits/{id}?dataset={name}` - Get commit metadata

**Status:** Not Started (Blocked by 4a)
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.2

**Design:** Minimal implementation (id, message, author, timestamp, parents, patchSize)
- No branches/tags lists (expensive O(n) scan)
- Read-only, no CQRS complexity

**Already Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ `POST /version/commits` - Create commit (apply RDF Patch)

---

#### 5. Batch Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md`](./batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/batch` - Execute batch of SPARQL operations atomically

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.6

**Features:**
- Atomic and non-atomic execution modes
- Single commit mode (combine all writes)
- Mixed operations (query, update, applyPatch)

**Note:** Distinct from `/version/batch-graphs` (Graph Store Protocol batch endpoint)

---

## Progress Summary

**Total Tasks:** 6 tasks (5 endpoint tasks + 1 schema evolution)
**Total Endpoints:** 8 endpoints
**Estimated Total Time:** 21-28 hours

**Priority Breakdown:**
- üî¥ High Priority: 2 tasks (Tags, Merge)
- üü° Medium Priority: 4 tasks (History, Schema Evolution, Commits, Batch)

**Current Status:** 1 of 7 tasks completed (14%)
- ‚úÖ Branch Management API (completed 2025-10-24)

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Add patchSize to Commit Entity** (3-4 hours) - **PREREQUISITE**
   - Schema evolution task
   - Blocking task for Commit Metadata API
   - Critical: Run @event-schema-evolution-checker after completion

2. **Commit Metadata API** (1-2 hours)
   - Simplest endpoint task
   - Read-only, no CQRS complexity
   - Good warm-up after schema change
   - **Depends on Task 1**

3. **Tag Management API** (3-4 hours)
   - Similar to branches (already implemented)
   - Immutability adds slight complexity

4. **History & Diff API** (4-5 hours)
   - Read-only operations
   - Diff requires RDF Patch serialization

5. **Batch Operations API** (4-5 hours)
   - Complex but modular
   - Reuses existing query/update logic

6. **Merge Operations API** (5-6 hours)
   - Most complex task
   - Requires merge algorithm
   - Should be implemented last

---

## Task File Structure

Each task file includes:

1. **Overview** - What needs to be implemented
2. **Current State** - What's already done
3. **Requirements** - API specification
4. **Implementation Steps** - Detailed step-by-step guide
5. **Success Criteria** - Definition of done
6. **Testing Strategy** - Test approach (API vs Projector tests)
7. **Files to Create/Modify** - Complete file list
8. **References** - Links to protocol specs and code

---

## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting a Task

1. Read the task file completely
2. Review the protocol specification
3. Check existing similar implementations for patterns
4. Plan test cases

### During Implementation

1. Follow TDD (write tests first)
2. Use `-q` flag for Maven commands
3. Run static analysis before tests: `mvn -q compile checkstyle:check spotbugs:check`
4. Implement incrementally (DTOs ‚Üí Command/Event ‚Üí Handler ‚Üí Controller)
5. **Invoke specialized agents** after implementation:
   - `@cqrs-compliance-checker` after command/projector changes
   - `@test-isolation-validator` after writing tests
   - `@event-schema-evolution-checker` after modifying events

### After Implementation

1. Run full build: `mvn -q clean install`
2. Verify zero quality violations
3. Create conventional commit message
4. **Delete the task file** when completed
5. Update this README (move task to "Completed Tasks" section)

---

## Testing Strategy

### API Layer Tests (90% of tests)
- Projector **DISABLED** by default
- Test HTTP status codes and headers
- Do **NOT** query repositories
- Example: `BranchControllerIT`

### Projector Tests (10% of tests)
- Projector **ENABLED** via `@TestPropertySource(properties = "projector.kafka-listener.enabled=true")`
- Use `await()` pattern for async verification
- Test event projection to repositories
- Example: `ReadModelProjectorIT`

See [Development Guidelines](../.claude/CLAUDE.md) for detailed testing patterns.

---

## Success Criteria for All Tasks

- ‚úÖ All endpoints return appropriate responses (no 501)
- ‚úÖ DTOs created with validation
- ‚úÖ CQRS pattern followed (Command ‚Üí Event ‚Üí Projector)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests pass (API layer)
- ‚úÖ Unit tests pass (command handlers)
- ‚úÖ Zero quality violations (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, PMD, compiler warnings)
- ‚úÖ Full build passes: `mvn -q clean install`
- ‚úÖ Task file deleted after completion
