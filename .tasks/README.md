- ‚úÖ Memory usage scales with branches, not history depth
- ‚úÖ CQRS compliant (projector maintains materialized views)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible (historical queries unchanged)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready monitoring and recovery

**CQRS Compliance:** ‚úÖ Full compliance
- Projector applies patches to materialized graphs (read model updates)
- DatasetService returns materialized graphs (query side)
- Events remain source of truth in CommitRepository

**Follow-Up Tasks (Production Hardening):**
5. [Task 05: Add LRU Eviction for Memory Management](./materialized-views/05-add-lru-eviction-for-memory-management.md) (4-5 hours) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Replace unbounded ConcurrentHashMap with Caffeine LRU cache

   - On-demand rebuild for evicted graphs
   - Cache metrics (hits, misses, evictions)
   - **Impact:** Prevents OutOfMemoryError in large deployments

6. [Task 06: Implement Fail-Fast Projection Errors](./materialized-views/06-implement-fail-fast-projection-errors.md) (2-3 hours) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Re-throw exceptions on patch application failures
   - Kafka retry with exponential backoff
   - Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed events
   - **Impact:** Ensures data consistency (no silent corruption)

---

### üî¥ High Priority

#### 1. Merge Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/merge/01-implement-merge-api.md`](./merge/01-implement-merge-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/merge` - Merge two refs/commits

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours (most complex)
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.3

**Complexity:**
- Three-way merge algorithm
- Conflict detection
- Multiple merge strategies (three-way, ours, theirs, manual)
- Fast-forward detection

---

### üü° Medium Priority

#### 2. History & Diff API
**File:** [`.tasks/history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md`](./history/01-implement-history-diff-blame-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /version/history` - List commit history with filters
- `GET /version/diff` - Diff two commits (returns RDF Patch)
- `GET /version/blame` - Last-writer attribution

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.2 (history), Extensions (diff, blame)

**Note:** Diff and blame are **extensions** (not in official SPARQL 1.2 spec)

---

#### 3. Batch Operations API
**File:** [`.tasks/batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md`](./batch/01-implement-batch-operations-api.md)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /version/batch` - Execute batch of SPARQL operations atomically

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Protocol Spec:** ¬ß3.6

**Features:**
- Atomic and non-atomic execution modes
- Single commit mode (combine all writes)
- Mixed operations (query, update, applyPatch)

**Note:** Distinct from `/version/batch-graphs` (Graph Store Protocol batch endpoint)

---

### üîµ Low Priority (Technical Debt)

#### 4. Refactor Squash/Rebase Handlers to Pure CQRS
**File:** [`.tasks/architecture/02-refactor-squash-rebase-to-pure-cqrs.md`](./architecture/02-refactor-squash-rebase-to-pure-cqrs.md)

**Problem:**
- `SquashCommandHandler` and `RebaseCommandHandler` write directly to repository
- Violates CQRS pattern (dual-write, no event replay)
- Breaks eventual consistency promise

**Solution:**
- Enrich events with full commit data (patch, patchSize, parents)
- Remove repository writes from command handlers
- Let projector handle all repository updates

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours
**Category:** Architectural Refactoring
**Complexity:** High

**Note:** This is technical debt, not a critical bug. Can be deferred.

---

### üü¢ Medium Priority (Performance Optimization)

#### 5. Parallel Event Replay
**File:** [`.tasks/performance/01-implement-parallel-event-replay.md`](./performance/01-implement-parallel-event-replay.md)

**Goal:** Reduce startup time by processing events in parallel using Kafka partitioning.

**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours
**Category:** Performance & Scalability
**Complexity:** High

**Problem:**
- Current: Single consumer processes ALL events sequentially
- Result: 10,000 events = 10 seconds startup (1ms/event)
- Bottleneck: Only one CPU core utilized

**Solution:**
- Partition topics by dataset (dataset = partition key)
- Multiple consumer instances (one per partition)
- Events for different datasets processed in parallel
- Startup time reduced by factor of N (partition count)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **10x faster startup** (with 10 partitions)
- ‚úÖ Better CPU utilization (all cores used)
- ‚úÖ Horizontal scalability
- ‚úÖ Dataset isolation

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased complexity (partition management)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No cross-dataset ordering guarantees
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cross-dataset operations become more complex

**When to Implement:**
- Large deployments (>100 datasets)
- Startup time critical (high availability requirements)
- Multiple CPU cores available

**Configuration:**
```yaml
chucc:
  kafka:
    partitions: 6  # Default
    consumer:
      concurrency: 6  # Match partition count
```

- Significant performance improvement (10-20x faster queries)
- Foundation for better user experience
- Independent of protocol endpoints (can be done in parallel)
- Production-ready monitoring and recovery

**Implementation order:**
1. **Task 01: MaterializedBranchRepository** (3-4 hours)
   - Foundation layer - no dependencies
   - Can be tested in isolation

2. **Task 02: Update ReadModelProjector** (4-5 hours)
   - Integrates with existing projector
   - Enables eager materialization

3. **Task 03: Update DatasetService** (3-4 hours)
   - Instant query performance
   - Backward compatible

4. **Task 04: Monitoring & Recovery** (3-4 hours)
   - Production operational tools
   - Completes the feature

**Alternatively:** Implement in parallel with protocol endpoints if multiple developers available.

---

### Feature Implementation

1. **History & Diff API** (4-5 hours)
   - Read-only operations
   - Diff requires RDF Patch serialization
   - Useful for debugging and auditing

2. **Batch Operations API** (4-5 hours)
   - Complex but modular
   - Reuses existing query/update logic
   - Performance optimization for bulk operations

3. **Merge Operations API** (5-6 hours)
   - Most complex task
   - Requires merge algorithm
   - Should be implemented last

### Infrastructure (Future/Optional)

**Recommended:** Defer until after feature implementation is complete.

5. **Per-Dataset Tuning** (4-5 hours)
   - Allows custom Kafka config per dataset
   - Nice-to-have for advanced use cases
   - Can be added later without breaking changes

6. **Topic Health Checks** (4-5 hours)
   - Automated health checks and self-healing
   - Improves operational reliability
   - Can be added incrementally

### Architecture/Technical Debt (Optional)

This task improves CQRS compliance but is not required for feature completeness:

**Refactor Squash/Rebase to Pure CQRS** (8-12 hours)
   - High complexity, significant refactoring
   - Fixes dual-write pattern and event replay
   - Enables proper eventual consistency testing
   - **Recommended:** Defer until production deployment is planned

---

## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting a Task

1. Read the task file completely
2. Review the protocol specification
3. Check existing similar implementations for patterns
4. Plan test cases

### During Implementation

1. Follow TDD (write tests first)
2. Use `-q` flag for Maven commands
3. Run static analysis before tests: `mvn -q compile checkstyle:check spotbugs:check`
4. Implement incrementally (DTOs ‚Üí Command/Event ‚Üí Handler ‚Üí Controller)
5. **Invoke specialized agents** after implementation:
   - `@cqrs-compliance-checker` after command/projector changes
   - `@test-isolation-validator` after writing tests
   - `@event-schema-evolution-checker` after modifying events

### After Implementation

1. Run full build: `mvn -q clean install`
2. Verify zero quality violations
3. Create conventional commit message
4. **Delete the task file** when completed
5. Update this README (move task to "Completed Tasks" section)

---

## Testing Strategy

### API Layer Tests (90% of tests)
- Projector **DISABLED** by default
- Test HTTP status codes and headers
- Do **NOT** query repositories
- Example: `BranchControllerIT`

### Projector Tests (10% of tests)
- Projector **ENABLED** via `@TestPropertySource(properties = "projector.kafka-listener.enabled=true")`
- Use `await()` pattern for async verification
- Test event projection to repositories
- Example: `ReadModelProjectorIT`

See [Development Guidelines](../.claude/CLAUDE.md) for detailed testing patterns.
