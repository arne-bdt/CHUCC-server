# Task 11: Conflict Detection - Implementation Summary

## Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE

### What Was Successfully Implemented

✅ **Core Conflict Detection Logic:**
- Extended `PatchIntersection.java` with `detectConflicts()` method
- Returns detailed conflict information with graph, subject, predicate, object fields
- Added `ConflictItem` conversion from Jena Node structures

✅ **Exception Handling:**
- Extended `ConcurrentWriteConflictException` to include `List<ConflictItem>`
- Added handler in `VcExceptionHandler` for 409 responses with conflict details
- Returns proper RFC 7807 problem+json format

✅ **Service Layer:**
- Created `ConflictDetectionService` for centralized conflict detection
- Implements semantic overlap detection by comparing patches
- Walks commit history to find intermediate commits

✅ **Integration with Command Handlers:**
- Updated all 4 graph command handlers (PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Added `ConflictDetectionService` as dependency
- Created `GraphCommandUtil.finalizeGraphCommand()` to eliminate duplication

✅ **Unit Tests:**
- `PatchIntersectionTest` - Tests conflict detection logic
- All handler unit tests updated with `ConflictDetectionService` mock
- All tests pass (775 tests, 0 failures)

✅ **Code Quality:**
- Zero Checkstyle violations
- Zero SpotBugs warnings
- Zero PMD violations (including CPD)

### What Is NOT Complete

❌ **Integration Tests for Concurrent Operations:**

The integration tests could not be implemented because of a **controller design limitation**:

**Problem:** The `GraphStoreController` always resolves `baseCommit` to the current branch head:
```java
// Line 405-406 in GraphStoreController.java
org.chucc.vcserver.domain.CommitId baseCommitId =
    selectorResolutionService.resolve(DATASET_NAME, effectiveBranch, null, null);
```

This means:
1. Client A reads graph at commit C1
2. Client A sends PUT → baseCommit = current head (C1) ✓
3. Client A's update creates commit C2, branch advances
4. Client B sends PUT → baseCommit = current head (C2) ✗ (should be C1 or earlier)
5. **No conflict detected** because currentHead (C2) == baseCommit (C2)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Client should specify their base commit (e.g., via If-Match ETag)
- Controller should use that ETag as the baseCommit, not the current head
- Then conflict detection would work: currentHead (C2) != baseCommit (C1) → check for conflicts

**Current Behavior:**
- If-Match is only used for precondition validation (returns 412 if mismatch)
- Base commit is always set to current head
- Concurrent write detection cannot function

### Root Cause of Missed Build Errors

The main issue was using `cmd.exe /c "mvn..."` which suppressed Maven output on Windows.

**Problem:**
```bash
# This suppressed error output
cmd.exe /c "mvn -q clean install"
```

**Solution (added to CLAUDE.md):**
```bash
# Use mvn directly, verify output
mvn -q clean install

# Always check for:
# - "Tests run: X, Failures: Y"
# - "BUILD SUCCESS" or "BUILD FAILURE"
# - If uncertain, run: mvn test 2>&1 | tail -50
```

### Recommendations

**To Complete Task 11:**

1. **Fix Controller to Support Base Commit from Clients:**
   - Parse If-Match header to extract client's base commit
   - Use that commit as baseCommit parameter (not current head)
   - Only use current head if client doesn't specify base

2. **Then Add Integration Tests:**
   - Test concurrent PUT with overlapping changes → 409
   - Test concurrent POST with same triples → 409
   - Test concurrent PATCH with same quads → 409
   - Test concurrent DELETE vs PUT → 409
   - Verify conflict response includes graph field

**Alternative Approach:**
- Document that concurrent write detection requires clients to use If-Match headers
- Create integration tests that explicitly use If-Match to demonstrate the feature
- Note: This would require controller changes first

### Files Modified

**Implementation:**
- `PatchIntersection.java` - Added conflict detection with details
- `ConcurrentWriteConflictException.java` - Added conflicts field
- `VcExceptionHandler.java` - Added 409 handler
- `ConflictDetectionService.java` (NEW) - Centralized conflict detection
- `GraphCommandUtil.java` - Added finalization helper
- All 4 graph command handlers - Integrated conflict detection

**Tests:**
- `PatchIntersectionTest.java` - Unit tests for conflict detection
- All 4 handler test files - Updated with ConflictDetectionService mock

**Documentation:**
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Added critical section on verifying build success
- `.tasks/gsp/11-conflict-detection-summary.md` (this file)

### Build Status

✅ **All Quality Gates Passed:**
- 775 tests passing (5 skipped)
- 0 failures, 0 errors
- 0 Checkstyle violations
- 0 SpotBugs warnings
- 0 PMD violations
- 0 CPD duplications

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify build output** - Don't assume success from empty output
2. **Avoid `cmd.exe /c`** for Maven commands - use mvn directly
3. **Test integration tests early** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Understand the full request flow** - Controller → Command → Service
5. **Integration tests require end-to-end functionality** - Can't test if API doesn't support the feature
