# Task 21: Final Integration Testing and Quality Assurance

## Objective
Run comprehensive integration tests to verify complete GSP implementation meets all requirements.

## Background
This is the final validation before considering GSP implementation complete. All previous tasks must pass.

## Tasks

### 1. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
mvn clean install
```
Verify:
- Zero test failures
- Zero Checkstyle violations
- Zero SpotBugs warnings
- Zero PMD violations

### 2. Manual Testing Scenarios
Create manual test checklist and execute:
- [ ] Create branch, commit graphs via GSP, query via Protocol
- [ ] Create branch via Protocol, commit graphs via GSP
- [ ] Merge branches with GSP commits
- [ ] Use time-travel (asOf) to query historical graph states
- [ ] Trigger and resolve conflicts
- [ ] Use batch operations
- [ ] Verify ETag behavior
- [ ] Test all RDF formats (Turtle, N-Triples, JSON-LD, RDF/XML)

### 3. Load Testing (Optional)
If performance is critical:
- Use JMeter or Gatling to load test GSP endpoints
- Verify performance under load
- Check for memory leaks
- Verify cache effectiveness

### 4. Spec Compliance Review
Review both specifications line-by-line:
- SPARQL 1.2 Graph Store Protocol
- Graph Store Protocol Version Control Extension

Create compliance checklist:
- [ ] All HTTP methods implemented (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS)
- [ ] All selectors work (branch, commit, asOf)
- [ ] All headers supported (ETag, If-Match, SPARQL-VC-*)
- [ ] All status codes correct (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 406, 409, 412, 415, 422, 500)
- [ ] All error codes implemented
- [ ] Conflict detection works
- [ ] No-op detection works
- [ ] Batch operations work
- [ ] Discovery (OPTIONS, Link headers) works
- [ ] Interoperability with Protocol works

### 5. Code Review
Conduct self-review or peer review:
- Check for code duplication
- Verify proper error handling
- Check for security issues
- Verify logging is appropriate
- Check for performance issues

### 6. Documentation Review
Verify all documentation is complete:
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] README updates (if needed)
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Error code reference
- [ ] Examples and tutorials

### 7. Create Compliance Report
Document what has been implemented:
- List all features
- List any deviations from spec
- List any optional features not implemented
- List any extensions beyond spec

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] Zero Checkstyle/SpotBugs/PMD violations
- [ ] Manual testing scenarios pass
- [ ] Spec compliance verified
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Compliance report created
- [ ] Ready for production use

## Dependencies
- All previous tasks (01-20)

## Estimated Complexity
Low-Medium (4-5 hours)

## Success Criteria
When this task is complete, the Graph Store Protocol implementation is ready for release.
