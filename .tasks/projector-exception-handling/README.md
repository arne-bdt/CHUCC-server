**Command-Side (Write Operations): ✅ COMPLETED**
- ✅ Fire-and-forget pattern fixed (2025-10-23, commit `bf828c2`)
- ✅ HTTP 202 Accepted implemented for eventual consistency
- ✅ Exception handling fixed in 13 command handlers
- ✅ Protocol specs updated, tests created

---

## Completed Work

### ✅ Task 01: Fix Kafka Manual Commit Configuration
**Completed:** 2025-10-23 (commits `5df63e0`, `039c072`)

**What was done:**
- Disabled auto-commit in KafkaConfig (`ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG = false`)
- Added `AckMode.RECORD` to commit offset only after successful processing
- Created ReadModelProjectorExceptionHandlingTest (3 unit tests)
- Updated documentation (ADR-0003, ReadModelProjector Javadoc)

**Result:** Eliminated race condition where failed events could be skipped.

### ✅ Task 02: Add Documentation
**Completed:** 2025-10-23 (commit `039c072`)

**What was done:**
- Enhanced ReadModelProjector.java class Javadoc with exception handling strategy
- Created ADR-0003: Projector Fail-Fast Exception Handling
- Updated docs/architecture/cqrs-event-sourcing.md with exception handling section
- Documented Kafka configuration in KafkaConfig.java

**Result:** Future developers understand why exceptions are rethrown and how to maintain this behavior.

### ✅ Task 03: Audit Codebase for Exception Handling
**Completed:** 2025-10-23

**What was done:**
- Searched for all `@KafkaListener` annotations
- Reviewed exception handling patterns across codebase
- Audited event publishers, command handlers, controllers
- Documented findings in [audit-findings.md](./audit-findings.md)

**Result:** Identified critical command-side issue (Task 04).

### ~~Task 05: Fix Kafka Auto-Commit~~ (Obsolete)
**Reason:** Duplicate of Task 01 (already completed).

### ✅ Task 04: Fix Command Handler Silent Failures
**Completed:** 2025-10-23 (commit `bf828c2`)

**What was done:**
- Fixed exception handling in 13 command handlers (replaced `.exceptionally()` with `.whenComplete()`)
- Implemented HTTP 202 Accepted for all write operations
- Added `SPARQL-VC-Status: pending` header for eventual consistency
- Updated protocol specs (SPARQL + Graph Store Protocol)
- Created EventualConsistencyIT and EventualConsistencyProjectorIT tests
- Updated 100+ integration test assertions to expect HTTP 202

**Result:** Eliminated silent data loss bug, honest HTTP semantics reflecting eventual consistency.
