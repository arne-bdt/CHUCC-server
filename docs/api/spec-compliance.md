| DELETE /version/tags/{name} | ✅ Implemented | Delete tags (configurable) |

## Error Handling

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| problem+json format | ✅ Implemented | RFC 9457 Problem Details |
| Canonical error codes | ✅ Implemented | All codes from spec §9 |
| Conflict items schema | ✅ Implemented | Required fields per spec |
| Structured error responses | ✅ Implemented | Consistent across all endpoints |

## Selectors

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| branch selector | ✅ Implemented | Query/update at branch HEAD |
| commit selector | ✅ Implemented | Query/update at specific commit |
| asOf selector | ✅ Implemented | Time-travel queries (with branch) |
| Mutual exclusivity | ✅ Implemented | branch XOR commit validation |
| asOf + branch allowed | ✅ Implemented | Per spec §3.2 |
| asOf + commit rejected | ✅ Implemented | Returns 400 Bad Request |

## Concurrency Control

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ETag headers | ✅ Implemented | Strong ETags with commit IDs |
| If-Match preconditions | ✅ Implemented | Optimistic locking for commits |
| Semantic conflict detection | ✅ Implemented | Via PatchIntersection algorithm |
| 412 Precondition Failed | ✅ Implemented | On ETag mismatch |

## Advanced Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| No-op patch detection | ✅ Implemented | Returns 204 No Content per spec §7 |
| Fast-forward merge | ✅ Implemented | Automatic when possible |
| Three-way merge | ✅ Implemented | With common ancestor detection |
| Patch inversion | ✅ Implemented | For revert operations |
| UUIDv7 commit IDs | ✅ Implemented | Sortable, timestamp-based |

## Event Sourcing & CQRS

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| RDF Patch events | ✅ Implemented | All operations as events |
| Kafka event store | ✅ Implemented | Persistent event log |
| Read model projectors | ✅ Implemented | Async repository updates |
| Command handlers | ✅ Implemented | CQRS pattern |

## Extensions (Not in Spec)

| Endpoint | Status | Configurable | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| GET /version/diff | ⚠️ Extension (501) | ✅ Yes | Compare any two commits |
| GET /version/blame | ⚠️ Extension (501) | ✅ Yes | Last-writer attribution |
| GET /version/branches | ✅ Extension | No | Convenience filter over /refs |

**Extension Configuration:**
- `vc.diff-enabled` - Enable/disable diff endpoint (default: true)
- `vc.blame-enabled` - Enable/disable blame endpoint (default: true for Level 2)

## Notes

- ✅ **Implemented**: Feature is complete and tested
- ⚠️ **Stub (501)**: Endpoint exists but returns 501 Not Implemented
- All spec-required features are implemented
- Extensions can be disabled via configuration
- Full compatibility with Graph Store Protocol
- CQRS architecture with event sourcing for auditability
- All operations are idempotent where possible

## Test Coverage

- Unit tests for all command handlers
- Integration tests for all endpoints
- Event projector integration tests
- Kafka integration tests
- Configuration-based feature toggling tests

## Deviations from Spec

None. All deviations are clearly marked as optional extensions that can be disabled.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement GET /version/history (currently 501)
- Implement GET /version/diff (currently 501)
- Implement GET /version/blame (currently 501)
